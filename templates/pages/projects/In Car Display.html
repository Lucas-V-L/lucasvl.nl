This is my homemade Android Auto headunit. It has a touch panel on a small CRT display, and connects to my car's stereo system for music. It also has built in music storage! I use a Raspberry Pi 4b as the computer, and the touch panel is hooked up via USB. The sound system attatched is put together from parts I purchased from goodwill, it sounds pretty good for what it is!
